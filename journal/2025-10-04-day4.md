# Journal — 2025-10-04 — DAY 4

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- The meaning of data quality: accuracy, completeness, reliability, relevance, timeliness.
- Common DQ check types: Range, Category, Freshness, Volume, Nulls, Referential Integrity.
- Trust = accuracy * transparency*timeliness.
- Difference between manual SQL tests vs dbt tests.
- Importance of transparency & “trust metrics” in dashboards

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Data Quality (DQ):** How reliable and trustworthy data is for making decisions.
- **Data Health Dashboard:** A visual tool showing the overall condition of datasets — e.g., freshness, nulls, and test pass rates.
- **Severity Levels (S0–S2):** Categories for how serious a DQ issue is — from critical (S0) to minor (S2).
- **Threshold:** A specific limit or boundary that defines when data passes or fails a quality check.
  

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Automation First- Used dbt for reusable, consistent tests instead of manual SQL only.
- Trustworthiness Over Perfection: Focused on transparency and monitoring instead of chasing 100% “clean” data.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- Ensures consistency when joining dimensions.
- Prevents bad data from polluting downstream layers.
- Connects technical validation to real-world meaning.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- What’s the best practice for setting thresholds in DQ tests like what % of nulls is acceptable?
- In team settings, who should own DQ incident response — the data engineer, analyst, or domain owner?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- Write short data definitions and disclaimers on dashboards to increase transparency.
- Implement dbt built-in tests (unique, not_null, accepted_values) and experiment with custom range checks.
- Compare and document differences between manual SQL vs dbt test results for transparency and learning.
  

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/ref
- https://clickhouse.com/docs

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
Today’s session made me realize that data quality goes beyond just cleaning — it’s really about earning trust in the data. I learned how checks, monitoring, and documentation all work together to keep data reliable. Working with dbt showed me how automation can make testing smoother and reduce human mistakes. I’m still curious about how to make these checks run continuously and trigger real-time alerts. Overall, this helped me see that trustworthy data is the backbone of every strong and meaningful dashboard.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
