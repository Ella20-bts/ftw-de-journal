# Journal — 2025-09-27 — DAY 3

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Saw how model naming conventions matter in dbt
- Learned some dbt compilation/debugging techniques
- Got technical walkthroughs on running dlt and dbt

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Staging Model (stg) / Clean :** A cleaned-up version of raw data, meant to standardize before marts.
- **Mart Model:** A business-facing model built on top of staging, often dimensional.
  

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Made sure I followed the data flow from raw → staging → marts to see where things were breaking.
- Paid attention to using clear and consistent naming so models are easier to track.
- Took a step-by-step approach when errors showed up instead of guessing right away.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- I assumed that consistency in naming is worth the extra typing because it avoids confusion later on.
- Decided to focus on understanding error messages instead of immediately searching for fixes online.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- What are best practices for debugging missing nodes in production-scale dbt projects?
- How do we decide on what data we need without overloading our storage?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- Try intentionally breaking a model name to practice debugging.
- Review and clean up the sources.yml to make sure all raw tables are declared.
- Document naming conventions for all staging and mart models.
  

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/ref
- https://clickhouse.com/docs

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
This week was more about clearing up confusion, but I actually found that really valuable. The girls (my teammates) made me see how small details, like naming conventions and using the right dbt function, can make or break a build. I’m realizing that debugging isn’t just about fixing errors—it’s about understanding the bigger picture of how models connect.Slowly but surely, I’m finding it easier to move through the workflow, Buuut It would really help to have a guide (reference) in the future that lays out what to do next, so I don’t fall into the same errors again.
