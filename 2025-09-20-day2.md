# Journal — 2025-09-20 — DAY 1

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Got the basics of SQL querying down — things like SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING.
- Learned about different key types: primary, foreign, composite, surrogate, and business keys.
- Understood how joins work INNER AND LEFT JOIN.
- Went through normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) and why it’s useful.
- Studied dimensional modeling (facts & dimensions) and the star schema.
- The importance of testing data / SANDBOX.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- Primary Key (PK): A unique identifier for each row in a table.
-Foreign Key (FK): A column that points to a primary key in another table to show relationships.

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Move data once!

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For an example exercise, I did X, because of Y

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- huhuhu, what is a data lake?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] study git

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://dataengineering.ph/

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

I'm surprised at how cool git is!


### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
